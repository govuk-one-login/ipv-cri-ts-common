<!-- This is critical for the automatic release pipeline as it tells it what changes have been made -->
<!-- Use 'fix' for patch changes, 'feat' for feature changes, and 'feat!' for breaking changes -->
<!-- See https://nx.dev/docs/guides/nx-release/automatically-version-with-conventional-commits for information -->

- [ ] [Conventional commit syntax](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) has been followed in all commit
      messages

<!-- Install and set up pre-commit following the guide here: https://pre-commit.com/ -->

- [ ] The code passes pre-commit checks

### Cross-repo tooling

<!-- Delete if changes DO include changes to cross-repo tooling (nx, TS, ESLint, bootstrap scripts etc) -->

- [ ] No tooling or configuration that applies to the whole repo has been changed

<!-- Delete if changes DO NOT include changes to cross-repo tooling (nx, TS, ESLint, bootstrap scripts etc) -->
