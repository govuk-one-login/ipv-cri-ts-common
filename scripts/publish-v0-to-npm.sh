# Use this script to publish a new package to npm. The package is published as v0.0.0 and is independent of
# any packages with the same name that you may have defined in the packages directory. That means any WIP
# code will not be published, only the bare-minimum package.json necessary to bootstrap the package in the
# registry.

# npm publish should ask you to log in with a browser automatically, so there is no need to provide an npm token.
