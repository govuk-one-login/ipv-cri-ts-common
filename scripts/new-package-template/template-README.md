## Usage

Feel free to use the below template, structure it differently or remove it entirely if it works better for the package.
Only the high-level detail of the intended use of the package is necessary; the intention is to tell consumers how to
use it without creating documentation that needs updating when we make minor releases. Most information should be
possible to infer from the names and type interfaces of exported resources. Details that would be affected by major
(breaking) releases are acceptable.

The following functions are exported:

| Function | Purpose     |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `myFn()` | Doing stuff |

## Module syntax

This module is currently built to both CJS and ESM standards, so should work universally. However, we expect be moving
to ESM-only in the near future.
